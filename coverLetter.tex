\makelettertitle

I am writing to express my strong interest in the \positionname role as described. With a PhD in Computational Finance (University of Essex, 2025) and extensive experience developing machine learning systems in both academic and commercial settings, I bring a rare combination of domain expertise, software engineering proficiency that aligns closely with the multidisciplinary demands of your position.

My doctoral research focuses on forecasting fundamental stock metrics—like earnings per share and free cash flows—using statistical and machine learning techniques. 
In parallel, my role as a Data Engineer at the UK Data Archive has allowed me to apply software engineering skills in practice: I designed and deployed a hierarchical ML pipeline that integrates tree-based models with LSTM and Feed-Forward networks for NLP multiclass classification, all deployed in the AWS cloud infrastructure. 
This solution automated previously manual processes and enabled the Archive to process more complex data sets faster and more efficiently.

Beyond technical contributions, I’ve actively fostered collaboration across disciplines. I’ve led seminars on ML applications in finance, pair-programmed with fellow PhDs on projects utilizing technologies ranging from GANs to genetic programming, and contributed to academic work on macroeconomic simulation and portfolio risk analysis.
This balance of individual ownership and team engagement is something I believe is essential for a role involving multi-partner coordination and both academic and commercial output.

The opportunity to work on predictive modeling, FX hedging strategies, and risk management directly appeals to my academic interests and past experience --- particularly from my time as an Analyst Intern at Beyond Borders Investment Strategies.
I’m confident that my hands-on expertise with time series models, stochastic processes, and heterogeneous data streams would be an asset to your team.

Thank you for considering my application. 
I’d be excited to further discuss how my skills can contribute to Sciopay’s mission. I’m available at your convenience and look forward to the opportunity to speak with you.
% I would welcome the chance to further discuss how I can contribute to your project’s goals.
