\makelettertitle

I am writing to express my strong interest in the \positionname~role at \companyshort. With a PhD in Computational Finance (University of Essex, 2025) and extensive experience in AI systems and other types of data-intensive applications, I bring advanced modeling and software engineering skills aligned with the interdisciplinary demands of this role.

As part of my PhD, I explored and applied machine learning algorithms and data analytics to predict the earnings per share data of US companies. My analysis and modeling results were presented at international computer science conferences and in journals. I also built Java-based data pipelines and an API to retrieve financial data from the Securities and Exchange Commission website, storing it in my local PostgreSQL server. This data is then used as the input to the ML forecasting system that I designed. Currently, I am finalizing a web application that predicts US stock earnings using my PhD research system, with Python, Java, JavaScipt, and SQL.

As a Data Engineer at the UK Data Service, I developed AI systems for individual household disclosure risk analysis using Python (PyTorch, Hugging Face, scikit-learn). I created and maintained pipelines for data collection, preprocessing, and standardization. In my team, I was also held responsible for coding, testing, and debugging AI prototypes to ensure robust and efficient performance. This gave me experience building UIs in TypeScript/React and integrating APIs for user authorization and AWS. Additionally, I monitored and enhanced the Model Context Protocol Application based on the performance metrics and feedback loops obtained from the data curation team.

I bring a collaborative mindset, having led seminars on ML in finance, pair-programmed on projects from GANs to genetic algorithms, and contributed to macroeconomic simulation research. I enjoy working across disciplines and believe collaboration is critical to creating a better future. As an individual with a keen interest in the financial services industry and investments, I believe that timely and reliable data delivery, paired with user-friendly analytical tools, is what helps make wise investments.

Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the chance to discuss how my skills can help empower \companyshort's misson with critical insights and intelligence to identify opportunities using thorough data analysis. I am available at your convenience and look forward to speaking with you.
