I am writing to express my strong interest in the Data Scientist role within at \companyshort. With a PhD in Computational Finance (University of Essex, 2025) and extensive experience developing time-series forecasting systems in both academic and commercial settings, I bring a blend of advanced modeling expertise and robust software engineering skills that aligns closely with the interdisciplinary demands of this position.

My doctoral research focuses on forecasting fundamental stock metrics --- such as earnings per share and free cash flows --- using transfer learning and the Bayesian Averaging of statistical and machine learning techniques, including autoregressive models, LSTMs, and tree-based ensembles.
While my background is rooted in financial modeling, the core challenge of understanding and predicting complex, dynamic systems is highly transferable to energy forecasting.
My experience working with heterogeneous, high-frequency and quarterly data and stochastic processes positions me well to contribute meaningfully to \companyshort’s forecasting objectives.

In my role as AI Engineer at the UK Data Archive, I designed and deployed a hierarchical machine learning pipeline that performs NLP classification of variables stored in XML format. The pipeline --- built using tree-based models, LSTMs, and feed-forward networks --- was deployed on AWS, automating manual processes and enabling efficient handling of large-scale datasets. 
Further, I tuned the Large Language Models, such as Llama and Gemini, to simplify the work of data curation team, which makes the process of validating social sciences data sets more automated and interactive. The designed LLM powered application helped to speed up the delivery of data sets to reaseachers. 

I also bring a strong collaborative mindset, having led seminars on ML applications in finance, pair-programmed with researchers on diverse machine learning projects, ranging from GANs to non-linear estimation with genetic algorithms, and contributed to academic work on macroeconomic simulation. I enjoy working across disciplines and believe that this collaborative approach is critical to creating a better future.

Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the opportunity to further discuss how my experience in quantitative modeling and development can support Capgemini’s clients in unleashing their potential, thereby creating a more sustanable and inclusive society. I am available at your convenience and look forward to the opportunity to speak with you.
